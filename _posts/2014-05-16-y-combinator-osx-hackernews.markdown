Hi,

I was developing a new app called HNewsTab. It's just mean to be an "self use app" and has no intention to be sold or deployed in App Store. This app is supposed to show the news of Y Combinator page Hacker News into Mac OSX menu bar.

My first idea was develop an app using an unofficial Y Combinator's Hacker News API (http://api.ihackernews.com/), TableViews and so on. After thinking a little while I decided to contruct a "wrapper" and embed an html5 app inside a WebKit view. Last night I saw this great web app developed by @cheeaun and I thought, hey, I can use that to show the HN into OSX menu bar.
